    <h2 id="#why">Why Meditate?</h2>
    <p class="quote">“Meditation is the dissolution of thoughts in Eternal awareness or Pure consciousness without objectification, knowing
        without thinking, merging finitude in infinity.” – Swami Sivananda</p>

    <p>Meditation can be defined as a practice where an individual focuses his or her mind on a particular object, thought or
        activity to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state Meditation may be used to reduce stress, anxiety,
        depression, and pain. Meditation is highly subjective and extremely personal, but today you will learn more about
        <em>Vipassana</em> meditation, also known as
        <em>insight</em> meditation.</em>
    </p>
    <h2 id="#vipassana">Vipassana</h2>

    <p> Vipassana in the Buddhist tradition means insight into the true nature of reality. In the Theravada tradition this specifically
        refers to insight into the Three marks of existence: impermanence, suffering or unsatisfactoriness, and the
        <em>realisation of non-self.</em>
        <p>Vipassana is a direct and gradual cultivation of mindfulness or awareness. It proceeds piece by piece over a period
            of years. The student's attention is
            <em>carefully</em> directed to an intense examination of certain aspects of his own existence. The meditator is trained
            to notice more and more of his own
            <em>flowing</em> life experience. </p>
        <p>The object of Vipassana practice is to learn to
            <em>pay attention</em>. We think we are doing this already, but that is an illusion. It comes from the fact that
            we are paying so little attention to the ongoing surge of our own life experiences that we might just as well
            be asleep. We are simply not paying enough attention to notice that we are not paying attention.</p>
        <p>Through the process of
            <em>mindfulness</em>, we slowly become aware of what we really are down below the ego image. We wake up to what life
            really is. an
            <em>illusion</em>. Life has a much deeper texture than that if we bother to look, and if we look in the right way.
            Vipassana is a form of mental training that will teach you to
            <EM>experience</EM> the world in an entirely new way. You will learn for the first time what is truly happening to
            you, around you and within you. It is a process of
            <em>self discovery
            </em>, a participatory investigation in which you observe your own experiences while participating in them, and
            as they occur. The practice must be approached with this attitude.</p>
        <p>Today you will learn a simplified version of the Vipassana practice, but will hopefully provide useful tools for
            you as you continue on with your day. </p>
        <p>Now, let's practice Vipassana meditation...</p>
